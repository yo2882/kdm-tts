# How to compile
Use luabundle (Current version 1.6), with the following batch file :
```bat
luabundler bundle Kdm\Global.ttslua ^
-p "?.ttslua" ^
-o bundle.lua
```
It requires the folder of the source files to be called Kdm, and the bundle.bat executable to be outside of it.  
I then use a Json Escaper (this one works well : https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html#ad-output) to get a single string of my bundle.lua file.  
I then open the save I want to edit, and replace the LuaScript Json Entry with my String instead.

That's it!
